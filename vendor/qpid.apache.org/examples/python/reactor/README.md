The examples in this directory provide a basic introduction to the
proton reactor API and are best viewed in the order presented below.

The examples contain comments that explain things in a tutorial-style
manner. At some point soon this content will be pulled out into a
proper tutorial that references the relevant code snippets from these
examples. Until then please bear with this clumsy style of
presentation.

This API is present in C as well and most of these examples will
transliterate into C in a fairly straightforward way.
